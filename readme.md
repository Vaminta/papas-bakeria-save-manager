# Papa's Save Manager
Papa's Save Manager (PSM), formerly known as PBSM is a userscript which allows you to backup save data for the Papa's series of flash games hosted on [Coolmath Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com/papas-games) and [CrazyGames](https://www.crazygames.com/t/papa). Backing up saves allows them to be restored in the event that browser data is accidentally/ unintentionally cleared, or if you wish to play your game on another browser or device.

The number of supported games is expected to increase with each new version.

## How to Install
The script must be installed into a userscript manager such as Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey.

2. Click [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/474235-papa-s-save-manager) to install the lastest release from greasyfork. Alternatively, you can install the latest pre-release by creating a new script, and pasting in the contents of src/papas-save-manager.js
